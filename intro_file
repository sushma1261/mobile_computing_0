Hi

The intended platform that I would want to work on for final project will be iOS and the programming language will be Swift. I have little context on Android and how the app works and I want to explore how things happen on iOS and hence want to try to develop an app on iOS using swift. I can explore cross-platform but I have a good experience working on React Native and hence would be more inclined to work on core native architectures of the mobile platforms.
